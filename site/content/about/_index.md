Hi! I’m Nir.

I can’t imagine my life without technology—it’s more than just work, it’s what I genuinely enjoy. From managing servers and automating systems to testing open-source projects and building custom solutions, tech keeps me curious and challenged every day. Whether I’m optimizing my home lab, experimenting with new tools, or learning about the latest trends, I always find something exciting to tinker with. For me, technology isn’t just a career—it’s a core part of who I am.

I’m passionate about exploring and testing new, interesting projects—especially anything related to IT, automation, and self-hosting. My home server is my playground for experimenting with the latest tech and trends.


I love electronic music production and have been using Ableton Live for over 10 years, with one full album released as **wigi-production** on [SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/Wi4k6tOD2m92vjBsag).


If you want to talk, collaborate, or just say hi, feel free to email me at **nir2010@gmail.com**.  
Thanks for stopping by!
